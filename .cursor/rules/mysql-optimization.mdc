# MySQL Optimization Guidelines

This package focuses on MySQL database table optimization. Follow these database-specific practices:

## Core Optimization Logic
- The main optimization logic is in [OptimizeTablesAction.php](mdc:src/Actions/OptimizeTablesAction.php)
- Queued optimization is handled by [OptimizeTablesJob.php](mdc:src/Jobs/OptimizeTablesJob.php)
- Both sync and async execution paths should be maintained

## Database Safety
- **NEVER** truncate database tables or run migration refreshes without explicit user consent
- Always validate table names and database connections before optimization
- Implement proper error handling for database connection failures
- Log all optimization operations with appropriate detail levels
- Provide clear feedback on optimization progress and results

## Performance Considerations
- Use MySQL's `OPTIMIZE TABLE` statement for InnoDB and MyISAM tables
- Consider table locking implications during optimization
- Implement timeouts for long-running optimization operations
- Monitor disk space requirements during optimization
- Handle large tables with appropriate memory considerations

## Configuration & Flexibility
- Allow users to specify which tables to optimize via configuration
- Support database connection specification for multi-database setups
- Provide options for batch processing large numbers of tables
- Include dry-run capabilities for testing optimization plans

## Error Handling & Logging
- Log optimization start/completion times and space savings
- Handle MySQL-specific errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages for common failure scenarios
- Track optimization statistics and results
