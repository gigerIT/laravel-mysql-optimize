# Console Command Development

Guidelines for developing robust Laravel console commands.

## Command Structure
- Console commands are located in [src/Console/Commands/](mdc:src/Console/Commands/)
- Follow Laravel's command naming conventions
- Use descriptive command signatures and descriptions
- Implement proper argument and option validation

## User Experience
- Provide clear, helpful command descriptions and usage examples
- Use progress bars for long-running operations
- Implement proper output formatting with colors and styling
- Include confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Provide meaningful feedback on operation results

## Input Validation
- Validate all command arguments and options
- Provide helpful error messages for invalid input
- Support both interactive and non-interactive execution
- Handle edge cases like missing required parameters

## Command Options
- Support `--table` option for specific table selection
- Support `--database` option for multi-database environments
- Include `--queued` option for background processing
- Implement `--dry-run` for testing without execution
- Add `--verbose` for detailed output

## Error Handling
- Catch and handle database connection errors gracefully
- Provide specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Include proper exit codes for script automation
- Log errors appropriately while providing user-friendly output

## Testing Commands
- Test commands with various argument combinations
- Verify output formatting and messaging
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Ensure commands work in both interactive and automated environments
